## Introduction

MongoDB's aggregation framework is a powerful tool for data transformation and analysis. However, when dealing with advanced text processing or machine learning tasks, the built-in operators might not suffice. What if we could extend this framework to integrate advanced language models directly into our aggregation pipelines?

In this blog post, we'll explore how to **extend MongoDB's aggregation framework** by incorporating custom operators that leverage language models. This approach enables dynamic text summarization, sentiment analysis, and moreâ€”all within your MongoDB queries.

---

## Motivation for Custom Operators

While MongoDB provides a rich set of aggregation operators, there are scenarios where we need functionality beyond what's available:

- **Advanced Text Processing**: Tasks like summarization, sentiment analysis, and entity recognition.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Incorporating predictive models directly into data processing pipelines.
- **Customized Operations**: Tailoring data transformations to specific business logic.

By introducing custom operators, we can:

- **Enhance Functionality**: Perform complex operations without external processing.
- **Simplify Architecture**: Reduce the need for additional systems or services.
- **Increase Efficiency**: Process data where it resides, minimizing data movement.
- **Maintain Full Control**: Customize every aspect of data processing to suit specific needs.

## Understanding the Implementation

Let's dive into how we can implement custom operators in MongoDB, specifically integrating a language model for text summarization and sentiment analysis.

### Setting Up the Dataset

We start with a sample dataset of movie reviews:

```python
DATASET = [
    {
        "_id": 1,
        "user": "Alice",
        "movie": "Inception",
        "rating": 5,
        "comment": "This movie is absolutely amazing! The plot twists and turns in ways you would never expect. Truly a masterpiece.",
        "status": "active"
    },
    # ... additional documents ...
]
```

This dataset contains user reviews that we want to analyze using a language model.

### Creating the `CustomMongoDB` Class

We create a `CustomMongoDB` class to handle aggregation with custom operators:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import uuid

class CustomMongoDB:
    def __init__(self, uri, database, collection, temp_prefix='temp'):
        self.client = MongoClient(uri)
        self.db = self.client[database]
        self.collection = self.db[collection]
        # Initialize the collection with the dataset
        self.collection.delete_many({})
        self.collection.insert_many(DATASET)
        self.custom_operators = {}
        self.temp_prefix = temp_prefix

    def add_custom_operator(self, name, func):
        """Add a custom operator to the collection."""
        self.custom_operators[name] = func

    # ... other methods ...
```

**Key Methods:**

- `add_custom_operator(name, func)`: Registers a custom operator.
- `aggregate(pipeline)`: Processes the pipeline, handling both standard and custom operators.
- `contains_custom_operator(stage)`: Checks if a pipeline stage contains any custom operators.
- `execute_sub_pipeline(collection, pipeline)`: Executes standard pipeline stages.
- `process_custom_stage(documents, stage)`: Processes stages with custom operators.

### Defining the `$prompt` Operator

We define a custom `$prompt` operator that interfaces with a language model:

```python
import ollama

desiredModel = 'llama3.2:3b'

# Custom operator function
def prompt_operator(doc, args):
    field = args[0]
    prompt_text = args[1]
    # Get the value from the document
    field_name = field  # Field name without '$'
    field_value = doc.get(field_name)
    if field_value is None:
        return None
    # Call the LLM with the field value and prompt text
    print(f"""
    [prompt]
    {prompt_text}
    [/prompt]
    [context]
    field: {field_name}
    value:
    {str(field_value)}
    [full document]
    {str(doc)}
    [/full document]
    [/context]
    """,)
    response = ollama.chat(model=desiredModel, messages=[
        {
            'role': 'user',
            'content': f"""
[prompt]
{prompt_text}
[/prompt]
[context]
field: {field_name}
value:
{str(field_value)}
[full document]
{str(doc)}
[/full document]
[/context]
""",
        },
    ])
    return response['message']['content']
```

This operator takes a field from the document and a prompt text, then generates a response using the language model.

### Constructing the Aggregation Pipeline

We build an aggregation pipeline that utilizes the custom `$prompt` operator:

```python
pipeline = [
    {
        '$match': {
            'rating': {'$gt': 3},
            'status': 'active'
        }
    },
    {
        '$project': {
            'user': 1,
            'movie': 1,
            'rating': 1,
            'comment': 1,
            'summary': {
                '$prompt': ['comment', 'Summarize the following movie comment in 5 words:']
            },
            'sentiment': {
                '$prompt': ['comment', 'Respond with the sentiment for the following comment in exactly 1 word: "positive", "neutral", or "negative":']
            }
        }
    },
    {
        '$sort': {'rating': -1}
    }
]
```

**Explanation:**

- **`$match` Stage**: Filters active documents with a rating greater than 3.
- **`$project` Stage**: Projects desired fields and uses `$prompt` to generate summaries and sentiments.
- **`$sort` Stage**: Sorts the results by rating in descending order.

---

## How It Works

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Pipeline Processing**:
   - The `aggregate` method processes each stage of the pipeline.
   - Standard stages are executed normally.
   - When a custom operator is detected, processing switches to handle it specifically.

2. **Custom Operator Detection**:
   - The method `contains_custom_operator` checks each stage for custom operators.

3. **Handling Custom Operators**:
   - Documents are fetched from the current collection.
   - The custom operator function (`prompt_operator`) is applied to each document.
   - Results are stored in a temporary collection to maintain pipeline flow.

4. **Continuation of Pipeline**:
   - The pipeline resumes with the temporary collection as the new data source.
   - Subsequent stages are processed accordingly.

5. **Cleanup**:
   - Temporary collections are deleted after the aggregation to free up resources.

---

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Seamless Integration**: Custom operators can be used alongside standard aggregation operators.
- **Flexibility**: Place custom operators anywhere in the pipeline.
- **Performance**: Reduce data transfer by processing within the database.
- **Maintainability**: Keep data processing logic in one place, simplifying updates and debugging.
- **Complete Control**: Customize every aspect of data processing, from operator definitions to pipeline execution.
